# Front-End-Project
This is for the Front End Web Development Final Project
This is my "website" for Software QA Consulting. Software QA Consulting is something that I may like to do once I learn more about programming.
I like QA UAT Testing and hope to become a senior QA engineer in the near future. 
My site is published at https://e0holl01.github.io/Front-End-Project/. To test the site, you can download the files and will need to unzip them. The easiest way I have done this is take the downloaded file, create a new folder and copy the files from the dowloaded folder to the new folder. 
There is an issue when sizing down to below the standard small screen pixel. The dev tools appears to be caching the font size and not making it responsive. However, the site will scroll. To test that the site is responsive, close the page, reopen the page and enter the screen size to confirm the site is responsive
