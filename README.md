# Front-End-Project
This is for the Front End Web Development Final Project
This is my "website" for Software QA Consulting. Software QA Consulting is something that I may like to do once I learn more about programming.
I like QA UAT Testing and hope to become a senior QA engineer in the near future. 
Nothing special is needed for the site. 
However, if you size down below the standard pixel size, the viewport is caching the font in the dev tools when you go to resize up the screen. To fix this and confirm the site is responsive, close the page, reopen and enter the specs manually and the page will view fine.
