# Front-End-Project
This is for the Front End Web Development Final Project
This is my "website" for Software QA Consulting. Software QA Consulting is something that I may like to do once I learn more about programming.
I like QA UAT Testing and hope to become a senior QA engineer in the near future. 
Nothing special is needed for the site. According to my mentors, if the site styling has issues, anything under 300 pixels
should not be counted against me. They have tried assisting me in any styling issues under 300 pixels and we have not been successful in 
fixing those issues. The issues are when the site is under 300 pixels and toggle is on , if you are in responsive and drag the site out the nav
items will stick and not expand.
